# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [2.5.2] - 2026-03-14

> Codex account quota policy with auto-rotation, fast tier toggle, gpt-5.4 model, and analytics label fix.

### ✨ New Features (PRs #366, #367, #368)

- **Codex Quota Policy (PR #366)**: Per-account 5h/weekly quota window toggles in Provider dashboard. Accounts are automatically skipped when enabled windows reach 90% threshold and re-admitted after `resetAt`. Includes `quotaCache.ts` with side-effect free status getter.
- **Codex Fast Tier Toggle (PR #367)**: Dashboard → Settings → Codex Service Tier. Default-off toggle injects `service_tier: "flex"` only for Codex requests, reducing cost ~80%. Full stack: UI tab + API endpoint + executor + translator + startup restore.
- **gpt-5.4 Model (PR #368)**: Adds `cx/gpt-5.4` and `codex/gpt-5.4` to the Codex model registry. Regression test included.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **fix #356**: Analytics charts (Top Provider, By Account, Provider Breakdown) now display human-readable provider names/labels instead of raw internal IDs for OpenAI-compatible providers.

> Major release: strict-random routing strategy, API key access controls, connection groups, external pricing sync, and critical bug fixes for thinking models, combo testing, and tool name validation.

### ✨ New Features (PRs #363 & #365)

- **Strict-Random Routing Strategy**: Fisher-Yates shuffle deck with anti-repeat guarantee and mutex serialization for concurrent requests. Independent decks per combo and per provider.
- **API Key Access Controls**: `allowedConnections` (restrict which connections a key can use), `is_active` (enable/disable key with 403), `accessSchedule` (time-based access control), `autoResolve` toggle, rename keys via PATCH.
- **Connection Groups**: Group provider connections by environment. Accordion view in Limits page with localStorage persistence and smart auto-switch.
- **External Pricing Sync (LiteLLM)**: 3-tier pricing resolution (user overrides → synced → defaults). Opt-in via `PRICING_SYNC_ENABLED=true`. MCP tool `omniroute_sync_pricing`. 23 new tests.
- **i18n**: 30 languages updated with strict-random strategy, API key management strings. pt-BR fully translated.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **fix #355**: Stream idle timeout increased from 60s to 300s — prevents aborting extended-thinking models (claude-opus-4-6, o3, etc.) during long reasoning phases. Configurable via `STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`.
- **fix #350**: Combo test now bypasses `REQUIRE_API_KEY=true` using internal header, and uses OpenAI-compatible format universally. Timeout extended from 15s to 20s.
- **fix #346**: Tools with empty `function.name` (forwarded by Claude Code) are now filtered before upstream providers receive them, preventing "Invalid input[N].name: empty string" errors.

### 🗑️ Closed Issues

- **#341**: Debug section removed — replacement is `/dashboard/logs` and `/dashboard/health`.

> API Key Round-Robin support for multi-key provider setups, and confirmation of wildcard routing and quota window rolling already in place.

### ✨ New Features

- **API Key Round-Robin (T07)**: Provider connections can now hold multiple API keys (Edit Connection → Extra API Keys). Requests rotate round-robin between primary + extra keys via `providerSpecificData.extraApiKeys[]`. Keys are held in-memory indexed per connection — no DB schema changes required.

### 📝 Already Implemented (confirmed in audit)

- **Wildcard Model Routing (T13)**: `wildcardRouter.ts` with glob-style wildcard matching (`gpt*`, `claude-?-sonnet`, etc.) is already integrated into `model.ts` with specificity ranking.
- **Quota Window Rolling (T08)**: `accountFallback.ts:isModelLocked()` already auto-advances the window — if `Date.now() > entry.until`, lock is deleted immediately (no stale blocking).

> UI polish, routing strategy additions, and graceful error handling for usage limits.

### ✨ New Features

- **Fill-First & P2C Routing Strategies**: Added `fill-first` (drain quota before moving on) and `p2c` (Power-of-Two-Choices low-latency selection) to combo strategy picker, with full guidance panels and color-coded badges.
- **Free Stack Preset Models**: Creating a combo with the Free Stack template now auto-fills 7 best-in-class free provider models (Gemini CLI, Kiro, iFlow×2, Qwen, NVIDIA NIM, Groq). Users just activate the providers and get a $0/month combo out-of-the-box.
- **Wider Combo Modal**: Create/Edit combo modal now uses `max-w-4xl` for comfortable editing of large combos.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Limits page HTTP 500 for Codex & GitHub**: `getCodexUsage()` and `getGitHubUsage()` now return a user-friendly message when the provider returns 401/403 (expired token), instead of throwing and causing a 500 error on the Limits page.
- **MaintenanceBanner false-positive**: Banner no longer shows "Server is unreachable" spuriously on page load. Fixed by calling `checkHealth()` immediately on mount and removing stale `show`-state closure.
- **Provider icon tooltips**: Edit (pencil) and delete icon buttons in the provider connection row now have native HTML tooltips — all 6 action icons are now self-documented.

> Multiple improvements from community issue analysis, new provider support, bug fixes for token tracking, model routing, and streaming reliability.

### ✨ New Features

- **Task-Aware Smart Routing (T05)**: Automatic model selection based on request content type — coding → deepseek-chat, analysis → gemini-2.5-pro, vision → gpt-4o, summarization → gemini-2.5-flash. Configurable via Settings. New `GET/PUT/POST /api/settings/task-routing` API.
- **HuggingFace Provider**: Added HuggingFace Router as an OpenAI-compatible provider with Llama 3.1 70B/8B, Qwen 2.5 72B, Mistral 7B, Phi-3.5 Mini.
- **Vertex AI Provider**: Added Vertex AI (Google Cloud) provider with Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash, Gemma 2 27B, Claude via Vertex.
- **Playground File Uploads**: Audio upload for transcription, image upload for vision models (auto-detect by model name), inline image rendering for image generation results.
- **Model Select Visual Feedback**: Already-added models in combo picker now show ✓ green badge — prevents duplicate confusion.
- **Qwen Compatibility (PR #352)**: Updated User-Agent and CLI fingerprint settings for Qwen provider compatibility.
- **Round-Robin State Management (PR #349)**: Enhanced round-robin logic to handle excluded accounts and maintain rotation state correctly.
- **Clipboard UX (PR #360)**: Hardened clipboard operations with fallback for non-secure contexts; Claude tool normalization improvements.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fix #302 — OpenAI SDK stream=False drops tool_calls**: T01 Accept header negotiation no longer forces streaming when `body.stream` is explicitly `false`. Was causing tool_calls to be silently dropped when using the OpenAI Python SDK in non-streaming mode.
- **Fix #73 — Claude Haiku routed to OpenAI without provider prefix**: `claude-*` models sent without a provider prefix now correctly route to the `antigravity` (Anthropic) provider. Added `gemini-*`/`gemma-*` → `gemini` heuristic as well.
- **Fix #74 — Token counts always 0 for Antigravity/Claude streaming**: The `message_start` SSE event which carries `input_tokens` was not being parsed by `extractUsage()`, causing all input token counts to drop. Input/output token tracking now works correctly for streaming responses.
- **Fix #180 — Model import duplicates with no feedback**: `ModelSelectModal` now shows ✓ green highlight for models already in the combo, making it obvious they're already added.
- **Media page generation errors**: Image results now render as `<img>` tags instead of raw JSON. Transcription results shown as readable text. Credential errors show an amber banner instead of silent failure.
- **Token refresh button on provider page**: Manual token refresh UI added for OAuth providers.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Provider Registry**: HuggingFace and Vertex AI added to `providerRegistry.ts` and `providers.ts` (frontend).
- **Read Cache**: New `src/lib/db/readCache.ts` for efficient DB read caching.
- **Quota Cache**: Improved quota cache with TTL-based eviction.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-03-13

### 🐛 Fix

- **Combos modal: Free Stack visible and prominent** — Free Stack template was hidden (4th in 3-column grid). Fixed: moved to position 1, switched to 2x2 grid so all 4 templates are visible, green border + FREE badge highlight.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-13

> **Major release** — Free Stack ecosystem, transcription playground overhaul, 44+ providers, comprehensive free tier documentation, and UI improvements across the board.

### ✨ Features

- **Combos: Free Stack template** — New 4th template "Free Stack ($0)" using round-robin across Kiro + iFlow + Qwen + Gemini CLI. Suggests the pre-built zero-cost combo on first use.
- **Media/Transcription: Deepgram as default** — Deepgram (Nova 3, $200 free) is now the default transcription provider. AssemblyAI ($50 free) and Groq Whisper (free forever) shown with free credit badges.
- **README: "Start Free" section** — New early-README 5-step table showing how to set up zero-cost AI in minutes.
- **README: Free Transcription Combo** — New section with Deepgram/AssemblyAI/Groq combo suggestion and per-provider free credit details.
- **providers.ts: hasFree flag** — NVIDIA NIM, Cerebras, and Groq marked with hasFree badge and freeNote for the providers UI.
- **i18n: templateFreeStack keys** — Free Stack combo template translated and synced to all 30 languages.

## [2.3.16] - 2026-03-13

### 📖 Documentation

- **README: 44+ Providers** — Updated all 3 occurrences of "36+ providers" to "44+" reflecting the actual codebase count (44 providers in providers.ts)
- **README: New Section "🆓 Free Models — What You Actually Get"** — Added 7-provider table with per-model rate limits for: Kiro (Claude unlimited via AWS Builder ID), iFlow (5 models unlimited), Qwen (4 models unlimited), Gemini CLI (180K/mo), NVIDIA NIM (~40 RPM dev-forever), Cerebras (1M tok/day / 60K TPM), Groq (30 RPM / 14.4K RPD). Includes the \/usr/bin/bash Ultimate Free Stack combo recommendation.
- **README: Pricing Table Updated** — Added Cerebras to API KEY tier, fixed NVIDIA from "1000 credits" to "dev-forever free", updated iFlow/Qwen model counts and names
- **README: iFlow 8→5 models** (named: kimi-k2-thinking, qwen3-coder-plus, deepseek-r1, minimax-m2, kimi-k2)
- **README: Qwen 3→4 models** (named: qwen3-coder-plus, qwen3-coder-flash, qwen3-coder-next, vision-model)

## [2.3.15] - 2026-03-13

### ✨ Features

- **Auto-Combo Dashboard (Tier Priority)**: Added `🏷️ Tier` as the 7th scoring factor label in the `/dashboard/auto-combo` factor breakdown display — all 7 Auto-Combo scoring factors are now visible.
- **i18n — autoCombo section**: Added 20 new translation keys for the Auto-Combo dashboard (`title`, `status`, `modePack`, `providerScores`, `factorTierPriority`, etc.) to all 30 language files.

## [2.3.14] - 2026-03-13

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **iFlow OAuth (#339)**: Restored the valid default `clientSecret` — was previously an empty string, causing "Bad client credentials" on every connect attempt. The public credential is now the default fallback (overridable via `IFLOW_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` env var).
- **MITM server not found (#335)**: `prepublish.mjs` now compiles `src/mitm/*.ts` to JavaScript using `tsc` before copying to the npm bundle. Previously only raw `.ts` files were copied — meaning `server.js` never existed in npm/Volta global installs.
- **GeminiCLI missing projectId (#338)**: Instead of throwing a hard 500 error when `projectId` is missing from stored credentials (e.g. after Docker restart), OmniRoute now logs a warning and attempts the request — returning a meaningful provider-side error instead of an OmniRoute crash.
- **Electron version mismatch (#323)**: Synced `electron/package.json` version to `2.3.13` (was `2.0.13`) so the desktop binary version matches the npm package.

### ✨ New Models (#334)

- **Kiro**: `claude-sonnet-4`, `claude-opus-4.6`, `deepseek-v3.2`, `minimax-m2.1`, `qwen3-coder-next`, `auto`
- **Codex**: `gpt5.4`

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Tier Scoring (API + Validation)**: Added `tierPriority` (weight `0.05`) to the `ScoringWeights` Zod schema and the `combos/auto` API route — the 7th scoring factor is now fully accepted by the REST API and validated on input. `stability` weight adjusted from `0.10` to `0.05` to keep total sum = `1.0`.

### ✨ New Features

- **Tiered Quota Scoring (Auto-Combo)**: Added `tierPriority` as a 7th scoring factor — accounts with Ultra/Pro tiers are now preferred over Free tiers when other factors are equal. New optional fields `accountTier` and `quotaResetIntervalSecs` on `ProviderCandidate`. All 4 mode packs updated (`ship-fast`, `cost-saver`, `quality-first`, `offline-friendly`).
- **Intra-Family Model Fallback (T5)**: When a model is unavailable (404/400/403), OmniRoute now automatically falls back to sibling models from the same family before returning an error (`modelFamilyFallback.ts`).
- **Configurable API Bridge Timeout**: `API_BRIDGE_PROXY_TIMEOUT_MS` env var lets operators tune the proxy timeout (default 30s). Fixes 504 errors on slow upstream responses. (#332)
- **Star History**: Replaced star-history.com widget with starchart.cc (`?variant=adaptive`) in all 30 READMEs — adapts to light/dark theme, real-time updates.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Auth — First-time password**: `INITIAL_PASSWORD` env var is now accepted when setting the first dashboard password. Uses `timingSafeEqual` for constant-time comparison, preventing timing attacks. (#333)
- **README Truncation**: Fixed a missing `</details>` closing tag in the Troubleshooting section that caused GitHub to stop rendering everything below it (Tech Stack, Docs, Roadmap, Contributors).
- **pnpm install**: Removed redundant `@swc/helpers` override from `package.json` that conflicted with the direct dependency, causing `EOVERRIDE` errors on pnpm. Added `pnpm.onlyBuiltDependencies` config.
- **CLI Path Injection (T12)**: Added `isSafePath()` validator in `cliRuntime.ts` to block path traversal and shell metacharacters in `CLI_*_BIN` env vars.
- **CI**: Regenerated `package-lock.json` after override removal to fix `npm ci` failures on GitHub Actions.

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Response Format (T1)**: `response_format` (json_schema/json_object) now injected as a system prompt for Claude, enabling structured output compatibility.
- **429 Retry (T2)**: Intra-URL retry for 429 responses (2× attempts with 2s delay) before falling back to next URL.
- **Gemini CLI Headers (T3)**: Added `User-Agent` and `X-Goog-Api-Client` fingerprint headers for Gemini CLI compatibility.
- **Pricing Catalog (T9)**: Added `deepseek-3.1`, `deepseek-3.2`, and `qwen3-coder-next` pricing entries.

### Fixed

- **KiloCode**: kilocode healthcheck timeout already fixed in v2.3.11
- **OpenCode**: Add opencode to cliRuntime registry with 15s healthcheck timeout
- **OpenClaw / Cursor**: Increase healthcheck timeout to 15s for slow-start variants
- **VPS**: Install droid and openclaw npm packages; activate CLI_EXTRA_PATHS for kiro-cli
- **cliRuntime**: Add opencode tool registration and increase timeout for continue

## [2.3.11] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **KiloCode healthcheck**: Increase `healthcheckTimeoutMs` from 4000ms to 15000ms — kilocode renders an ASCII logo banner on startup causing false `healthcheck_failed` on slow/cold-start environments

## [2.3.10] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **Lint**: Fix `check:any-budget:t11` failure — replace `as any` with `as Record<string, unknown>` in OAuthModal.tsx (3 occurrences)

### Docs

- **CLI-TOOLS.md**: Complete guide for all 11 CLI tools (claude, codex, gemini, opencode, cline, kilocode, continue, kiro-cli, cursor, droid, openclaw)
- **i18n**: CLI-TOOLS.md synced to 30 languages with translated title + intro

## [2.3.8] - 2026-03-12

## [2.3.9] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **/v1/completions**: New legacy OpenAI completions endpoint — accepts both `prompt` string and `messages` array, normalizes to chat format automatically
- **EndpointPage**: Now shows all 3 OpenAI-compatible endpoint types: Chat Completions, Responses API, and Legacy Completions
- **i18n**: Added `completionsLegacy/completionsLegacyDesc` to 30 language files

### Fixed

- **OAuthModal**: Fix `[object Object]` displayed on all OAuth connection errors — properly extract `.message` from error response objects in all 3 `throw new Error(data.error)` calls (exchange, device-code, authorize)
- Affects Cline, Codex, GitHub, Qwen, Kiro, and all other OAuth providers

## [2.3.7] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **Cline OAuth**: Add `decodeURIComponent` before base64 decode so URL-encoded auth codes from the callback URL are parsed correctly, fixing "invalid or expired authorization code" errors on remote (LAN IP) setups
- **Cline OAuth**: `mapTokens` now populates `name = firstName + lastName || email` so Cline accounts show real user names instead of "Account #ID"
- **OAuth account names**: All OAuth exchange flows (exchange, poll, poll-callback) now normalize `name = email` when name is missing, so every OAuth account shows its email as the display label in the Providers dashboard
- **OAuth account names**: Removed sequential "Account N" fallback in `db/providers.ts` — accounts with no email/name now use a stable ID-based label via `getAccountDisplayName()` instead of a sequential number that changes when accounts are deleted

## [2.3.6] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **Provider test batch**: Fixed Zod schema to accept `providerId: null` (frontend sends null for non-provider modes); was incorrectly returning "Invalid request" for all batch tests
- **Provider test modal**: Fixed `[object Object]` display by normalizing API error objects to strings before rendering in `setTestResults` and `ProviderTestResultsView`
- **i18n**: Added missing keys `cliTools.toolDescriptions.opencode`, `cliTools.toolDescriptions.kiro`, `cliTools.guides.opencode`, `cliTools.guides.kiro` to `en.json`
- **i18n**: Synchronized 1111 missing keys across all 29 non-English language files using English values as fallbacks

## [2.3.5] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- **@swc/helpers**: Added permanent `postinstall` fix to copy `@swc/helpers` into the standalone app's `node_modules` — prevents MODULE_NOT_FOUND crash on global npm installs

## [2.3.4] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- Multiple provider integrations and dashboard improvements
